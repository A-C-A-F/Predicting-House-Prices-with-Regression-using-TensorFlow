# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Regression-using-TensorFlow
Predicting House Prices with Regression using TensorFlow


In this project, We are looking to solve a regression problem. With the help of a neural network model and some data in a regression task, we train the neural network to predict a continuous value, given a set of input features. This is different from classification. In classification problems, we train a model to predict
discrete values or classes.

Given some data with these features and the corresponding price for various houses, we will create and train a model that will give us fairly
accurate price predictions for new, unseen data.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Learn to create, train and evaluate neural network models with TensorFlow and Keras.
2.	Learn to solve regression problems with the help of neural networks.


### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Introduction to the house pricing problem
- __Task 2:__ Importing and cleaning the dataset
- __Task 3:__ Data Normalization
- __Task 4:__ Training and Test Sets
- __Task 5:__ Creating the Model
- __Task 6:__ Model Training
- __Task 7:__ Predictions
